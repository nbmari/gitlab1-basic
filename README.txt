In order to build an application, you need to use the touch command in order to create files in a certain directory. After creating those files, you can edit them and add functionality. After adding them, create a remote repository in your current directory in order to save these changes you are making. Then, stage the files using git add -A, or git add filename, filename being whatever file you would like to stage. If you wish to unstage something, then use git reset filename in order to unstage that file. After you have all the files you want to commit to the remote repository, use git status in order to check up on what files are staged, which files are not staged, and what branch you are working within, and if you are not working within the desired branch, use git branch branchname to create a branch named branchname, and then switch to the branch using git switch master. After all of this, you can commit your files to the remote repository using git commit -m "Commit message". Note that "Commit message" can be whatever message you want to devote to that commit.
